DIPPLANNER
==========

WARNING
-------

This software is provided free of charge for experienced divers to evaluate diving profiles.
This software is highly experimental, it probably contains bugs and should not be relied upon for actual dives. Use it at your own risk.

If you follow dive schedules generated by this software you could suffer decompression sickness, serious injury or possibly death.
The author does not warrant that this software accurately reflects Buhlmann's algorithms, or that it will produce safe, reliable, results.

Diving in general is fraught with risk, and decompression diving using mixed gases and rebreathers adds significantly more risk. This software is not intended for uneducated users.
This software and the decompression schedules it produces are tools for experienced divers only.

IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO THIS STATEMENT DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE

Calculations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main principe of dipplanner calculation are to be as accurate as possible,
using the most precise algorithm.

* All internal calculation in SI Units
* Most precise calculations (trying to avoid any approximation):

  * second to second decompression time calculation (adjustable)
  * real water density calculation
  * real gaz pressure calculation in tanks using van der waals
  * real surface pressure calculation (using Antoine equation for ppH2O)
  * ...

* Every parameter is adjustable

.. warning:: in result of the "precise" calculations, the planned dives may be
             shorter than other equivalent dive planification programs.

             Users of dipplanner MUST be aware of this difference and adjust
             the conservatisms to their wishes.

             On the other way, with the most precise calculations, dipplanner
             try to avoid unexpected effects (or worse: unseen effects) of
             approximations. (approximation effect to conservatism are sometimes
             counter-intuitive and may in some cases reduce the conservatism
             without warning)

Get the sources
---------------

latest source code (unstable)

please use git to clone the repository :

git clone git://github.com/ThomasChiroux/dipplanner.git

Installing
----------

There is no installation yet, so to use dipplanner, just get the code and run dipplanner.py (or dipplanner.exe if you've downloaded the windows package)

Using
-----

This version if currently only usable in command line

Run the program
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

for linux or macos (or if you want, windows with python installed) :
Run the program (from dipplanner directory) : dipplanner.py
ex:

::

    python dipplanner.py --help
or:

::

    ./dipplanner.py --help

for windows
Run the programm : dipplanner.exe
ex:

::

    dipplanner --help
or:

::

    dipplanner.exe --help

Planning one dive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To plan a dive, you should at least provide one tank and one dive segment.
Here is below a sample for a 12l tank with 200b of air and a dive of 25min at 30m

::

    ./dipplanner.py -t "airtank;0.21;0.0;12;200;50b" -s "30;25*60;airtank;0.0"

You can provide more than one tank and of course multiple segments (they will be processed in the order you provided it)
Deco tanks will be automaticaly choosen if appropriate.
Here is below a sample for a trimix dive : bi 12l-cylinder of Tx21/30 and Deco Nx80 (S80), 50m - 20mins:

::

    ./dipplanner.py -t "tx;0.21;0.30;24;200;50b" -t "deco;0.8;0.0;12;200;50b" -s "50;20*60;tx;0.0"

Change some parameters of the dive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See --help output to see all available parameters

Config files
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can provide one or several config files to the program.
The config file can overide any default parameter.
see config/default_config.cfg for all the details

parameter are changed using this order:
1) default parameter
2) parameter set in config files
3) parameter set in command line

Units : SI or Imperial
----------------------

dipplanner uses only SI unit internally.
However a config parameter or a command line parameter can change this behaviour.
and use imperial Units

if imperial unit is set in a config file :
   all the parameters from this config file and all the config files
   read after will be considered imperial (including command line parameters)
   But all the parameter in previous config files will still be considered as SI
   All the ouput will be done in imperial units

if imperial unit is set in command line :
   all the parameter given in command line will be considered imperial,
   but not the parameters eventually given using config files
   All the output will be done in imperial units

SI and imperial unit converter uses the following correspondances:
* bar <--> psi
* liter <--> cubic feet
* meter <--> feet
