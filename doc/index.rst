======================================

.. warning::

   This software is provided free of charge for experienced divers to evaluate diving profiles.
   This software is highly experimental, it probably contains bugs and should not be relied upon for actual dives. Use it at your own risk.

   If you follow dive schedules generated by this software you could suffer decompression sickness, serious injury or possibly death.
   The author does not warrant that this software accurately reflects Buhlmann's algorithms, or that it will produce safe, reliable, results.

   Diving in general is fraught with risk, and decompression diving using mixed gases and rebreathers adds significantly more risk. This software is not intended for uneducated users.
   This software and the decompression schedules it produces are tools for experienced divers only.

   IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO THIS STATEMENT DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE
