{"name":"Dipplanner","body":"DIPPLANNER\r\n==========\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis software is provided free of charge for experienced divers to evaluate diving profiles.\r\nThis software is highly experimental, it probably contains bugs and should not be relied upon for actual dives. Use it at your own risk.\r\n\r\nIf you follow dive schedules generated by this software you could suffer decompression sickness, serious injury or possibly death.\r\nThe author does not warrant that this software accurately reflects Buhlmann's algorithms, or that it will produce safe, reliable, results.\r\n\r\nDiving in general is fraught with risk, and decompression diving using mixed gases and rebreathers adds significantly more risk. This software is not intended for uneducated users.\r\nThis software and the decompression schedules it produces are tools for experienced divers only.\r\n\r\nIF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO THIS STATEMENT DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE\r\n\r\nGet the sources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nlatest source code (unstable)\r\n\r\nplease use git to clone the repository :\r\n\r\ngit clone git://github.com/ThomasChiroux/dipplanner.git\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThere is no installation yet, so to use dipplanner, just get the code and run dipplanner.py (or dipplanner.exe if you've downloaded the windows package)\r\n\r\nUsing\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis version if currently only usable in command line\r\n\r\nRun the program\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n    for linux or macos (or if you want, windows with python installed) :\r\n    Run the program (from dipplanner directory) : dipplanner.py\r\n    ex: python dipplanner.py --help\r\n    or : ./dipplanner.py --help\r\n\r\n    for windows\r\n    Run the programm : dipplanner.exe\r\n    ex: dipplanner --help\r\n    or: dipplanner.exe --help\r\n\r\nPlanning one dive\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nTo plan a dive, you should at least provide one tank and one dive segment.\r\nHere is below a sample for a 12l tank with 200b of air and a dive of 25min at 30m\r\n\r\n./dipplanner.py -t \"airtank;0.21;0.0;12;200\" -s \"30;25*60;airtank;0.0\" \r\n\r\nYou can provide more than one tank and of course multiple segments (they will be processed in the order you provided it)\r\nDeco tanks will be automaticaly choosen if appropriate.\r\nHere is below a sample for a trimix dive : bi 12l-cylinder of Tx21/30 and Deco Nx80 (S80), 50m - 20mins:\r\n\r\n ./dipplanner.py -t \"tx;0.21;0.30;24;200\" -t \"deco;0.8;0.0;12;200\" -s \"50;20*60;tx;0.0\" \r\n\r\nChange some parameters of the dive\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nSee --help output to see all available parameters\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n\r\n    at first this program is a python rewrite of MV-Plan a dive planning tool written in java by Guy Wittig\r\n    ref used for programming and understand algorythms\r\n\r\nOpen Source and Licence\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
